# odin-recipes
This is my attempt at the recipes project from the odin project
I got the recipes from https://www.allrecipes.com and followed the instructions form the assignment
I tried my best with the git commits but I still have no idea how the should look like
The only thing i added is a link to the home page at the end of the recipes
