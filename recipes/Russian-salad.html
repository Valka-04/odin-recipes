     <h1>Russian Salad</h1>
     <img src="../images/salad.png" alt="image of the salad" width="500">
     <p>This Russian salad recipe is what my mom and grandmother make every time there's a family gathering or a special occasion. Leave out the ham to make this a vegetarian dish. The potatoes, carrots, and eggs do not have to be completely chilled after boiling.</p>
